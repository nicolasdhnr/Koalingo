<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to Koalingo, a cutting-edge React app designed for the Pace Center. With this app, you can create custom study sets for sign language words that we have animated and view and memorize the words in action, making learning sign language fun and interactive. Currently, it's built as a Kahoot-like quiz designed to be played in a classroom, or with friends and family!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Our idea

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 18.13.0 or higher
To check your version of Node.js, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
node -v
```
If your version is lower than 18.13.0, you can download the latest version from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website or update it using a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodist](https://github.com/nullivex/nodist).

### Getting Started
To get started with Koalingo, you can clone this repository. Navigate to the /koalingo folder and run the following commands to get the app up and running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## How to play
1. Login to the app.
2. Choose your study set from the available words in our word bank.
3. Create a game and share the game pin with your friends.
4. On your friends' phones, type the game pin on the home page.
5. Once everyone has joined, you can start the game!
6. Players will be given time to memorize the words.
7. Take the quiz section to test your knowledge.

## Contributing
We rely on our open-source community to help us create more animations. We are in the process of making a platform to help submit animations to enlarge our word bank, but in the meantime, if you have an animation you would like to contribute, please email them to me at Nicolasdhnr@gmail.com. All of our blender files are included in this repository in the blender folder! We are extremely grateful for any and all contributions.
